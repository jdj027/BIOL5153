#### AREAS OF PROFESSIONAL SPECIALIZATION

My interests lie in biological/biomedical research with a particular emphasis on novel imaging methodologies and diagnostic techniques. Research and publications have revolved around using multiphoton microscopy to noninvasively detect metabolic changes associated with diabetes and aging in the context of wound healing to improve clinical outcomes.
